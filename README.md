## 1. Introduction.
<img src="express.png" height="150"> 
Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.<br><br>

Express is a fast, unopinionated and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express is a **server-side** or **back-end** framework. It is not comparable to client-side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue. It can be used in combination with those frameworks to build full stack applications.

The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of the MEAN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and AngularJS front-end framework. Express.js was founded by TJ Holowaychuk. The first release, according to Express.js's GitHub repository, was on the 22nd of May, 2010. Version 0.12

In June 2014, rights to manage the project were acquired by StrongLoop. StrongLoop was acquired by IBM in September 2015; in January 2016, IBM announced that it would place Express.js under the stewardship of the Node.js Foundation incubator.
